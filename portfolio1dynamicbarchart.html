        <h2>From the Arts, to Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            I was born in Upstate, New York to two ESL teachers. I am half Brazilian, half American, 100% Mets fan. Growing up, I went to a boarding arts school where I studied film production. After working in film for many years, I decided to settle down and live a less travel-heavy career. Thus, I began studying data analytics with Bloomtech in late 2022. Recently, I have been flexing my strength as a data analyst, creating dynamic bar charts, using excel to clean projects and Tableau/Power Bi to analyse them. I plan to unite my background with a future in AI, by creating animation tools in my spare time that help me to automate my own creative process. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me! <br><br>
